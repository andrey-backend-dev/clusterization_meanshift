# MeanShift Clusterization
## The task of machine learning using a MeanShift method.

### Task:

Let's imagine that the international cruise agency Carnival Cruise Line decided to advertise itself with the help of banners and turned to you for this. To test whether such banners are of great use, only 20 of them will be placed around the world. You need to choose 20 such locations for placement, so that the benefits are great and the agency continues to cooperate with you.

### Initial Data:

To find the best places, we will use the database of the largest social network based on locations â€” Foursquare.

Part of public data is [here](https://archive.org/details/201309_foursquare_dataset_umn).
We need to download a zip from there and get the checkins.dat
